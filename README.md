# Wi-Fi Password Viewer

This script allows you to view the saved Wi-Fi passwords on your Windows PC using the netsh command.

## Prerequisites

- Windows operating system
- Administrative privileges

## Usage

1. Download the `netsh.bat` script to your computer.

2. Double-click the `netsh.bat` file to run it. Alternatively, you can open a command prompt, navigate to the directory where the script is saved, and run `netsh.bat`.

3. The script will display a banner and then proceed to show the Wi-Fi network names and their corresponding passwords.

4. If prompted, provide administrative credentials to allow the script to access the necessary information.

5. Once the script completes, it will display a message indicating that the script execution has finished.

**Note:** The script utilizes the netsh command, which is a built-in tool in Windows. In case netsh is not available or not working properly, you may need to troubleshoot your system or seek further assistance from a professional.

## Important Considerations

- Running the script with administrative privileges is necessary to access the Wi-Fi password information.

- The script displays sensitive information, such as Wi-Fi passwords, so exercise caution when using it in public or shared environments.

- This script is provided as-is without any warranty. Use it at your own risk.

## Troubleshooting

- If you encounter issues with netsh or suspect system file corruption, you can try running the System File Checker (SFC) utility. Open an elevated Command Prompt and type `sfc /scannow`. Follow the on-screen instructions and restart your computer if necessary.

- For more complex issues or if the troubleshooting steps mentioned earlier do not resolve the problem, it's advisable to consult a professional technician or contact Microsoft Support for further assistance.
